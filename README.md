## Clone the repository

Clone the present repository into your server

## .env file creation

At the root of your current folder (`/OpenSTEAM-LMS/`) create a `.env` file.
Inside of this file, copy/paste the following

``` 
VS_HOST=
VS_DB_HOST=**localhost**
VS_DB_PORT=**3306**
VS_DB_NAME=
VS_DB_USER=
VS_DB_PWD=
VS_MAPS_API_KEY=
VS_CAPTCHA_SECRET=
VS_CAPTCHA_PUBLIC_KEY=
VS_MAIL_SERVER=
VS_MAIL_PORT=
VS_MAIL_TYPE=
VS_MAIL_ADDRESS=
VS_MAIL_PASSWORD=
VS_REPLY_TO_MAIL=support@your_company_name.com
VS_REPLY_TO_NAME=Support # it can be Support,Contact or something else
VS_SET_FROM=your_website.com

# set the default student name to every classroom to be created
VS_DEMOSTUDENT=vittademo

# path to use for the activity logger(ie: routing/Routing.php)
VS_LOG_PATHH=/logs/log.log

# setup the new admin data
ADMIN_PSEUDO=PSEUDO
ADMIN_PASSWORD=PASSWORD
ADMIN_EMAIL=EMAIL

# registration's fields options
USER_USERNAME=false
USER_BIO=false
USER_PHONE=false
# Subject can not be true if grade is not true 
USER_TEACHER_GRADE=false
USER_TEACHER_SUBJECT=false
USER_TEACHER_SCHOOL=false


# if set to false, the automatique mail sent before registration will be deactivate
VS_AUTO_MAIL=true

#uploads paths (default: public folder at root level)
VS_RESOURCE_UPLOAD_DIR=public/content/user_data/resources
```


Don't forget to fill/change these constants with relevant information (at least all the VS_DB)

## VirtualHost Setup

1. Open your hosts file with admin privileges (`C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts`) or  (`sudo nano /etc/hosts`)

2. Modify your hosts file by adding this line: `127.0.0.1 steamlms`

3. 🏗️ Add steamlms:80 as a VirtualHost in your XAMPP/MAMP/hosting software

4. Make sure that PHP is running a version 7.x (with x above 2) and that NodeJS at least 14 is there.

5. Choose a logs directory. By default, this is `/logs/`. You can change this value using the entry in the `.env` named  `VS_LOG_PATH`, e.g. `VS_LOG_PATH=/tmp/log`.

## Dependencies

Run `composer install` to download all the needed PHP dependencies.
Then, run `npm install` to download all the needed JavaScript dependencies (for instance for the gulp build...).

Now you should be able to access the lms on your browser in ```http://steamlms/classroom```
The default account login is ```the email you provide here ADMIN_EMAIL``` and password is ```the password you provided here ADMIN_PASSWORD```

## Database setup

To setup the database, type this command in your shell: php sql-files/SteamLmsGenerateDb.php
Make sure you added the necessay informations (below # setup the new admin data) in the .env file
Then you have to check if the created database name match the VS_DB_NAME in the .env file.

## Architecture

![](open-steam-architecture.jpg?raw=true)
## Build

When changing the view files or when working on a plugin, you need to run a gulp build to apply the changes on the L.M.S.

To do so, you just need to follow few steps:

1. Open a terminal

2. Go to the OpenSTEAM LMS folder

3. Type the command ```gulp build```

4. Wait for the tasks to finish

5.  If using php-fpm, restart or refresh it, e.g. `service php7.4-fpm restart`and voilà !

## Plugins

If you need to add some features and/or theme design which aren't relevant in the OpenSTEAM LMS core, you must create plugins. To do so you need to respect a certain directory structure for your plugin folder(s) and some recommendations.Also, your plugin directory has to be named using the PascalCase convention (ie. MyFirstPlugin)

### 1. Create your plugin(s) directory

#### Plugin directory tree

```
+---YourPluginDirectory
|   +---Controller
|   +---Entity
|   +---public
|   |   +---css
|   |   +---images
|   |   \---js
|   +---Repository
|   +---Traits
|   \---Views
```

#### Where do I need to put my plugin directory ?

You just need to put it in a folder named ```plugins``` at the root of the OpenSTEAM LMS (It is in the .gitignore, so you'll probably have to create it).

### 2. Create your plugin files and put them in the relevant folders
- Your custom controller file(s) in the ```Controller``` folder
- Your custom entitie file(s) in the ```Entities``` folder
- Your custom css file(s) in the ```public/css``` folder
- Your custom image file(s) in the ```public/images``` folder
- Your custom javascript file(s) in the ```public/js``` folder
- Your custom view file(s) in the ```Views``` folder

</ul>

*As far as possible, avoid to change the view files. Otherwise, it'll be more difficult to retrieve changes from the LMS core in future updates*

### 3. Launch the Build

Follow the steps described in the Build section above

## Email Templates

Once you have set up all the fields related to emails + the ```VS_HOST``` in your .env file, the users who will register or request an email address update will receive a confirmation email to active their new account/ confirm their new email address.

A default html email is used, but you can create your own html emails and overwrite the default email templates.

How to do ?

- create a folder at the root of openSteamLMS and name it ```emailTemplates```
- inside emailTemplates folder, add a 'Fr' and a 'En' folder for example
- inside theses folders, add a ```en_confirm_account.php``` and a ```en_confirm_email_update.php``` file (these files will contain your email's html markups)

email directory tree

```
+---database
+---emailTemplates
|   +---En
|       +---en_confirm_account.php
|       +---en_confirm_email_update.php
|   +---Fr
|       +---fr_confirm_account.php
|       +---fr_confirm_email_update.php
+---gulp
```
Note: your email template have to have a ```<div> <?php echo  $body;?> </div>``` variable hard coded.

If you go to openSteamLMS/vendor/vtuser/src/Controller/ControllerUser, you will find the register and update_user_infos methods that have a ```$body``` defined.

This $body variable will be injected inside your html emails before sending each email.
